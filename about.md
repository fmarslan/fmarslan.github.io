    <h2>Hello there 👋</h2>
    <p>I’m Fatih. The photo on the homepage is me on a day off, backpack over the shoulder and notebook in hand. That’s more or less how I work too: curious, relaxed, and always ready to draw a quick sketch when words aren’t enough. I started by repairing old PCs for neighbours, and that practical habit slowly turned into a career that now stretches across Europe.</p>
    <p>These days I focus on platform design, integration work, and keeping developer workflows tidy. Fourteen-plus years in the field taught me that good architecture is equal parts empathy and engineering. I still code, still pair with teammates, and I try to keep the temperature low even when pressure is high.</p>

    <h2>How I like to work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I use plain language and lightweight diagrams so everyone stays on the same page.</li>
      <li>I offer feedback the way I’d like to receive it: honest, calm, and useful.</li>
      <li>I’m comfortable switching between time zones and cultures; EU-wide collaboration keeps me sharp.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Outside of work</h3>
    <p>Long walks, photography, and hunting for a decent flat white. Fresh air keeps my head clear for the next workshop.</p>

    <h3>Let’s collaborate</h3>
    <p>I’m open to hybrid or remote roles around Europe. If you need a thoughtful review, help steadying a roadmap, or simply someone who stays until the job is done, feel free to reach out.</p>
