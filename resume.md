I’m a software engineer who enjoys turning messy problem statements into architectures that people can actually build. Over the past 14+ years I’ve moved between Türkiye, the Benelux region, and distributed teams, staying close to both the code and the conversations that guide it.

Most weeks you’ll find me shaping solution architecture, integrating data pipelines, or tuning Kubernetes and cloud resources. The tools change, but the habits stay the same: write things down, share context, and keep the system honest once it reaches production.
