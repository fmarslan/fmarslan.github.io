    <h2>Hello there 👋</h2>
    <p>I’m Fatih. The photo on the homepage shows me exactly how I work—backpack on, smiling, ready to head out for a hike and then come back to sketch architecture diagrams. I started by fixing PCs in a small neighborhood shop and now collaborate with European companies that value thoughtful engineering.</p>
    <p>For 14+ years I’ve been designing platforms, integrations, and developer workflows. I never stopped writing code and genuinely enjoy pairing with teammates. What partners remember is a calm engineer who keeps promises and makes complex topics approachable.</p>

    <h2>How I like to work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I translate plans into plain language—if there’s no diagram, I’ll draw one.</li>
      <li>Feedback is honest and kind; team culture matters as much as delivery.</li>
      <li>I’m comfortable with distributed European teams and adapting to new cultures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Outside of work</h3>
    <p>Long walks, photography, and discovering new coffee spots. Fresh air helps me return to the desk with clear ideas.</p>

    <h3>Let’s collaborate</h3>
    <p>I’m open to hybrid or remote projects. If you need a candid architectural review, help moving from MVP to scale, or simply a steady teammate, drop me a message.</p>
