  title: I build practical, reliable platforms.
  description: |
    Hi, I’m Fatih. I’ve spent the past 14+ years shaping solution architecture, cloud platforms,
    and integrations so product teams can keep shipping without drama. I still dive into the code,
    still draw workflows on real paper when screens get crowded, and I’ve learned that steady delivery
    starts with plain language and honest expectations.

  eyebrow: How I help
  title: Architecture, delivery, and enablement
  description: |
    I start by listening, map what’s really happening in the stack, and turn those notes into plans
    that engineers, ops, and product folks can live with. I stay close to delivery until the platform
    is running in production, because the truth always shows up there.

        Making sense of brownfield systems, defining service boundaries, breaking up monoliths
        when it helps, and keeping APIs predictable so teams stop arguing about them.

      copy: |
        Kubernetes, infrastructure as code, observability stacks—mostly the boring but important
        things that keep cloud-native platforms stable without turning your engineers into full-time ops.

        Led a multi-tenant integration hub that ingested documents from ERPs, SaaS tools,
        and partner APIs, then routed them through validation, PEPPOL, national gateways,
        and auditors. Predictable workflows turned chaos into calm.
