    <h2>Hello there 👋</h2>
    <p>I’m Fatih. I grew up fixing neighbours’ PCs, carried that curiosity into public-sector projects, and now support teams across Türkiye, the Benelux, and the wider EU. My approach stays the same: stay calm, map the system, and sketch until everyone understands the moving parts.</p>
    <p>These days I focus on solution architecture, integration design, and the DevOps practices that stop releases from becoming fire drills. Fourteen-plus years in the field reminded me that durable platforms come from listening, writing things down, and staying close to production when it matters most.</p>

    <h2>How I like to work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I use plain language, lightweight diagrams, and source-controlled docs so ideas survive beyond the meeting.</li>
      <li>I give feedback the way I’d like to receive it: specific, steady, and focused on making the code or system better.</li>
      <li>I’m comfortable switching between tech stacks and time zones; mixed teams have been my norm for years.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Outside of work</h3>
    <p>Long walks, photography, and hunting for a good espresso. Fresh air keeps my head clear for the next workshop.</p>

    <h3>Let’s collaborate</h3>
    <p>I’m open to hybrid or remote roles across Europe. If you need a thoughtful review, help steadying an integration roadmap, or simply a partner who stays until the job is done, feel free to reach out.</p>
