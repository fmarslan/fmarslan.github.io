  title: I build practical, reliable platforms.
  description: |
    Hi, I’m Fatih. For more than 14 years I’ve been helping product teams untangle their systems,
    clean up messy architectures, and get real features out the door without wearing everyone down.
    I still jump into the code when it’s needed, still sketch things on paper when the screen is too much,
    and I’ve learned that being clear and decent with people usually makes everything work smoother.

  eyebrow: How I help
  title: Architecture, delivery, and enablement
  description: |
    I’m usually the one who joins a messy whiteboard session, listens first,
    and then slowly turns the scattered ideas into something teams can actually build.
    And I try to stay involved long enough to see it run in production—because the real problems
    always show up there.

      copy: |
        Making sense of systems, defining boundaries, breaking up monoliths when it really helps,
        and designing APIs that teams don’t argue about every week.

        Kubernetes, IaC, observability stacks—mostly the boring but important things
        that help small teams stay stable without turning into an ops department.

    A few projects that taught me patience, clearer thinking,
    and the value of simple, well-tested tools—even when the environment is anything but simple.

      title: Document intelligence platform @ Eaglessoft
      copy: |
        Led a multi-tenant integration hub that handled documents from all kinds of systems
        and pushed them through validation, PEPPOL, country gateways, and various partners.
        It reminded me how much calm you gain from predictable workflows.
