## ðŸ§¾ Summary

I have been working in software development for over 14 years. In every project I have worked on, I focused on technology transformation, ensuring smooth transitions to new technologies and infrastructure. I have researched, planned, and implemented modern architectures that improve cost efficiency and performance.

I am not deeply specialized in a single field but rather have broad expertise across multiple technologies. I actively develop in many programming languages and have successfully built microservices and functional services. My experience includes cloud migration, Kubernetes infrastructure, and AI-powered analytics. I enjoy working with teams that value collaboration and knowledge sharing, and I am looking for opportunities where I can expand my network and exchange knowledge in a win-win environment.
