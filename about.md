    <h2>Why I build</h2>
    <p>I wrote my first lines of code in a small Anatolian workshop where hardware repairs shared the same desk with Pascal books. That curiosity grew into a 14+ year career leading teams across Europe, building products for governments, fintechs, health orgs, and retail innovators.</p>
    <p>I thrive in ambiguous spaces: turning napkin sketches into platform strategies, aligning executives with engineering reality, and translating complex stacks into stories everyone understands.</p>

    <h2>Principles I keep close</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Design for change — architectures should invite iteration, not resist it.</li>
      <li>Measure narrative as well as metrics — clarity keeps squads moving.</li>
      <li>Automate empathy — observability, docs, and tooling exist to serve people.</li>
    </ul>
